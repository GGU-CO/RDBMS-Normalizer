# RDBMS-Normalizer
This code is designed for a database normalization task, taking in functional and multivalued dependencies to analyze and restructure data according to the user-specified target normal form. Each normal form (1NF to 5NF) progressively reduces data redundancy and dependency, helping to maintain data integrity and streamline queries.
